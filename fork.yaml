    This is an overview of the changes in [`astria-geth`](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria-geth),
    a fork of [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), part of the Astria-stack.

    The Astria-stack architecture is modular, following the Consensus/Execution split of post-Merge Ethereum L1:
      - [`astria-geth`](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria-geth) implements the Execution-Layer, with **minimal changes** for a secure Ethereum-equivalent application environment.

            The execution implements the [execution api÷ø](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/main/specs/execution-api.md) of the shared sequencer.
            Its procedures will be called from the [conductor](https://github.com/astriaorg/astria/blob/main/specs/conductor.md). It is responsible
            for immediately executing lists of ordered transactions that come from the shared sequencer.
